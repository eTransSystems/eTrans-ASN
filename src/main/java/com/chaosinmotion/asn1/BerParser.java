/**
 * The root BerParser object provides a wrapper for a BerInputStream to help
 * parse the ASN.1 contents. A BerParser object passes an additional bit of
 * information, the 'state' flag, which corresponds to the ASN.1 component that
 * is being constructed.<br><br>
 * It is worth noting that an ASN.1 specification specifies all ASN.1 grammars
 * as LL(1) parsers. This basically means that we only need two bits of 
 * information to know what we're currently parsing: the current state in a
 * finite-state machine (represented here as an integer with the start state
 * given the arbitrary value 0), and the current token being parsed. You can
 * see this when examining an ASN.1 specification; all the tokens are set up
 * so that you only need these two bits of information when making a parser
 * decision.<br><br>
 * To that end, a 'state' value is passed around while reading tags. This state
 * value needs to be set to an integer representing the current ASN.1 production
 * rule being read.<br><br>
 * To construct a BER parser for a particular ASN.1 grammar, you would create
 * an instance of this, and override the 'create' method. The create method
 * will only be called when parsing a non-universal tag. (Universal tags are
 * built independently of state, and are handled separately.) Your create method
 * should then examine the current tag and state, decide which object to
 * construct, then construct that object--passing in a new state if the
 * object to be constructed is a complex type, such as an embedded tag, set
 * or sequence.
